## What is Power BI?
- Power BI is a term used to describe two different tools - Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service (also referred to as PowerBI.com).  
- Power BI Desktop is a separate tool to Excel and is free to download and use. There are also paid versions of Power BI Desktop (Pro and Premium) which provide greater collaboration for businesses.  
- This tool uses the same Power Query and Power Pivot engines to get, clean and model your data ready for reporting. So when you learn these tools in Excel, you are learning them for Power BI Desktop also.
